Texas Maps

A repository of Texas geodata.

GitHub GeoJSON limitations
--------------------------

GitHub will only preview GeoJSON files that are less than 10 MB. Instead of forcing simplications on those large files just to play nicely with the preview, I instead put the full size result of a .shp to .geojson conversion up.
